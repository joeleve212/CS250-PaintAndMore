The extra feature: Choosing and placing an image as a sticker

This is a useful and viable tool to force upon future classes because:
- Placing stickers is a good way to integrate multiple images together
- This forces students to think about how images are actually handled,
which was helpful for me, since I was foggy on that subject throughout the project
- This feature has opportunity for improvements in subsequent iterations
